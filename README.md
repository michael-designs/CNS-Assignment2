This is a simple app that can compute encryption and decryption with AES, 3DES, OTP
###################################################################################
OTP(one time pad)
In cryptography, the one-time pad is an encryption technique that cannot be cracked, but requires the use of a single-use pre-shared key that is not smaller than the message being sent. In this technique, a plaintext is paired with a random secret key.
AES
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cipher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information.
3DES
In cryptography, Triple DES, officially the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm, is a symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block.

The GUI(Graphical User interface) was made using python tkinter framework
It works like a container, which is responsible for arranging the position of other widgets. It uses rectangular areas in the screen to organize the layout and to provide padding of these widgets. A frame can also be used as a foundation class to implement complex widgets.
